Summary: Soylent is an open-source food movement, focused on developing easy, fast and cheap ways of getting optimal nutrition.

[Soylent](http://soylent.me) began as a kickstarter campaign proposing an alternative to traditional meal regiments and is named after the 1973 film *Soylent Green* - a dystopian film in which the world is plagued by overpopulation and the general populace survives on tasteless rations produced by the Soylent Corporation.

While liquid, nutritional meal replacements are not a new idea (i.e. Ensure has been around for years), previous iterations were not intended as a food substitute. The goal of soylent is to completely replace physical food for normal people by incorporating everything recommended by the FDA and other nutritional authorities.
